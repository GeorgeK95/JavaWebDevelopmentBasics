    The Brown Bear
</h1>
<p>
    The brown bear (Ursus arctos) is the most widely distributed bear and is found across much of northern Eurasia and
    North America. It is one of the largest living terrestrial members of the order Carnivora, rivaled in body
    size only by its close cousin, the polar bear (Ursus maritimus), which is much less variable in size and slightly
    larger on average.
